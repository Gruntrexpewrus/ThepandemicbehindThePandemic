|Look just like the photo|I love the shoes they are true to size , I wear a 7 1/2 but I ordered a 8 to allow a little extra room and I got just that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |18 Sep 2018|Size: 8 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey  |https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wdRdaAfmL._SY88.jpg|Yes     |Diane Johnson   |5.0   |Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes|https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews|
|After 20 returns        |Just writing a rare review on these . I love Nikeâ€™s but my feet donâ€™t usually. So Iâ€™ve ordered and returned a lot. Tried again lol and these ARE AMAZING comfortable. So much that I may order 3 more this year just to have them. The color is so cute and clean and sporty. Iâ€™m 99.9% sure Iâ€™ve dinally found a pair of Nikes Iâ€™m not going to return , fingers crossed ðŸ¤žðŸ˜Š                                                                                                                         |08 May 2019|Size: 10 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey |https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717EKthL0BL._SY88.jpg|Yes     |sherlain miranda|4.0   |Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes|https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews|
|Half size up :)         |I have only run in them a couple of times, but so far they feel great. I normally wear a size 9, and I ordered a 9.5, and Iâ€™m glad I did. There is plenty of room, but not too much. The only thing that will take me getting used to is that they are slightly bulkier than my ASICS. Like any running shoes, Iâ€™m sure it will take a little bit of time to work out the stiffness and fully break them in, but they are amazing!                                                                     |14 Dec 2018|Size: 9.5 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ap+mslLBL._SY88.jpg|Yes     |Blondie         |5.0   |Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes|https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews|
|Surprisingly comfortable|I have a very hard time finding shoes that are comfortable for me, I have severe fibromyalgia with no help from medications because nothing works for me. So I am constantly looking for comfortable clothing and sneakers. Usually nike isnt good for me but after deciding to give this pair a try I was happy I did. Not only are they nice looking but they really are comfortable. I wore them all day today did a lot of walking and have zero issues with my feet hurting.

|Great, Comfortable Shoe |This is my second pair.  They are the most comfortable tennis shoes I own, I can be on my feet all day and they don't hurt.  I normally wear a 8.5 but in this shoe I wear a 9.  I find the toe box is wider and more comfortable especially if I wear a little thicker sock, it's just roomy enough to my toes are scrunched together.  I don't have a wide foot either.                                                                                                                              |18 Jul 2017|Size: 9 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey  |                                                                      |Yes     |msgrnbay        |5.0   |Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes|https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews|
